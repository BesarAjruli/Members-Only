# Clubhouse Project(Members Only)

## Overview

This project is about building an exclusive clubhouse for members to share anonymous posts. It focuses on creating a platform where:

Members can write and view posts within the clubhouse.
Inside the clubhouse, members can see who wrote each post.
Outside the clubhouse, only the content of the posts is visible, keeping the authors anonymous.
The project combines authentication and database skills, providing a practical way to reinforce these concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Secure login system to ensure only verified members can access the clubhouse.
2. **Anonymous Posting:** Posts are visible to the public, but the identity of the authors is hidden unless viewed within the clubhouse.
3. **Database Management:** Posts and user information are securely stored and retrieved using a relational database.
4. **Access Control:** Clear differentiation between member and non-member views.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js, Express.js.
- **Frontend Framework:** Ejs.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication:** Passport.js.

## Learning Objectives

Implementing user authentication and access control.
Structuring and managing data with relational or non-relational databases.
Applying business logic to differentiate user experiences based on authentication status.
